         At the begining in the first year of first semester it was really 
         hard to understand the concept of programming. It was difficiult
         phase to start any new field. But in the end i was started to understand
         the basic fundamentals of coding and the result of my hardwork
         was excellent. My merit was 80+ in second semester.

         Last year of BCA was challenging because collages were shut down
         due to covin-19 pendimic everywhere in the state it was lockwown
         and that time i was in my vilage without any of my books and equipments
         i was just attending my lectures with my phone and thats all i got
         there. The most imortant thing was my project. All students must
         start their project when the year was started and i was stuck

                People usually ask me about my dressing and wearings most of the 
            time. Questions like from where i have been getting my clothes form which
            shop and how costly it is and where i am learning the dressing sense.
            Wearing any dress is not the only ethics of Dressing. personality and 
            attitude is also and important factor.

          on my dressing. My neck is high then average person so i like to
          wear high neck tshirts and a good high collar shirt. Regarding pants 
          mostly i like to wear skinny jeans not too much but comfortable.
          My favourate color is Black my 80% of clothes are black in color.

          I have't wear too many suits but i like old suit styles 90s.
          other than black i also like blue and purple color. If you
          really want to wear good than first be good listner and speak less
          then observe different people that how they talk walk and wear.
          Using Internet is also a  good way to find new style. And do not
          be a copycat wear what suits to you not only body but also in 
          your mind. And put yourself fit and active drink more water 
          eat less and sleep less.

          with every outfit but now people choose their formal, semoformal,
          sports and canvas with their respective clothes.

            FIrst thing is my mask. Iwear a mask on my face since i was in 
            high school and now due to corona virus pendimic it is too much
            common and compulsory to wear a mask. I used to wear a mask not 
            because to hide my face, it is because i am allergic to sun 
            and unhygienic dust and pollution it just dont suits to me.
